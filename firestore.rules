/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles
 * and allows public read access to car listings, bookings, notifications, and reviews, with owner-only write access.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles. Document ID is the Firebase Auth UID.
 * - /cars/{carId}: Stores car listings.
 * - /bookings/{bookingId}: Stores car rental bookings.
 * - /notifications/{notificationId}: Stores notifications for users.
 * - /reviews/{reviewId}: Stores reviews for car rentals.
 * - /locations/{locationId}: Stores map location data.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User profiles are strictly owned by the authenticated user. Only the user can read/write their own profile.
 * - Car listings, bookings, notifications, and reviews are publicly readable.
 * - Car listings, bookings, notifications, and reviews can only be created, updated, or deleted by an authenticated user
 *   who is the owner of the specific resource. This assumes that the resources each have a field like `ownerId` or
 *   `userId` that matches the authenticated user's `uid`.
 * - Location data is publicly readable for use in maps, but can only be written by authenticated users.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *   The rules rely on each document having an `ownerId` or `userId` field to determine ownership for write operations.
 *   For example, a car document must have an `ownerId` field that matches the user ID of the car's owner.
 *   Similarly, a booking document must have `customerId` for who made the booking and `ownerId` for the car owner.
